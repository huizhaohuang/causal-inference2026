# Causal Inference Lab Material (Spring 2026 - Hertie School)

## Lab 1 (Potential Outcomes)
We first review the counterfactual theory of causation and the potential outcomes framework.

During this lab, we start by calculating different estimatiors on a generated datasete. Then, we explore the Lalonde dataset from 1986 and add some extentions developed by [Imbens & Wu, (2025)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.20251440). The complete replication package from the paper is available [here](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/232201/version/V1/view?path=/openicpsr/232201/fcr:versions/V1/replication) and an additional tutorial developed be the authors can be found [here](https://yiqingxu.org/tutorials/lalonde/).
